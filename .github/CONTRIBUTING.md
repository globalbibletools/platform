## Getting Started

### Issues

#### Creating Issues

If you have an idea or find a bug, [create an issue](https://github.com/globalbibletools/platform/issues/choose) after you've already searched the issues to see if one already exists.

#### Working on an issue

Issues in the Ready column of the [project](https://github.com/orgs/globalbibletools/projects/1/views/1) are ready to be worked on. Pick from these issues to have a greater chance of having your PR accepted.

Create a branch from the main branch either in your [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) or in project repo to do your work in.

### Pull Requests

#### Opening a Pull Request

When you have a change that is ready for review, open a PR on GitHub to the main branch. Please note that there is no guarantee a PR will be accepted. Maintainers have limited time, so low quality PRs are likely to be rejected.

- Fill in the PR template to ensure the reviewer has everything necessary for the review
- Use [conventional commits as your PR name](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). The most common prefixes we use are `feat:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`, and `docs:`.
- [Link the PR](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) to the issue for reference.
- If opening a PR from a fork, [allow the reviewer to make updates to your branch](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork). This can speed up the review process.
- The reviewer may ask for changes. Please make those changes and then mark each comment as resolved when complete. Request a new review when all work is complete.

#### Merged Pull Request

Congratulations on your contribution! It is much appreciated. Once accepted and merged, your PR will be immediately deployed to globalbibletools.com and be available to all users.
